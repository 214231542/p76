<h1>Solar Eclipse</h1>

<p>
    A solar eclipse occurs when the moon gets between Earth and the sun, and the moon casts a shadow over Earth.
     A solar eclipse can only take place at the phase of new moon,
     when the moon passes directly between the sun and Earth and its shadows fall upon Earthâ€™s surface.
     An annular eclipse, though a rare and amazing sight, is far different from a total one. The sky will darken ... somewhat; a sort of weird "counterfeit twilight" since so much of the sun still shows.
      The annular eclipse is a subspecies of a partial eclipse, not total.
       The maximum duration for an annular eclipse is 12 minutes 30 seconds.
       However, an annular solar eclipse is similar to a total eclipse in that the moon appears to pass centrally across the sun.
